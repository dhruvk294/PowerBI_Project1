# Bank Loan Analysis on PowerBI
Banks and financial institutions regularly issue loans to individuals for various purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvement, or personal expenses. However, assessing the creditworthiness of applicants and monitoring the performance of issued loans is critical to minimizing defaults and maximizing returns. By analyzing loan data, banks can gain insights into borrower behavior, loan performance trends, and risk factors.
This project uses historical loan data to build a Power BI dashboard that enables better decision-making through visual insights.
Objectives:
1. To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides visual analysis of loan-related metrics.
2. To identify key patterns and trends in loan issuance, funding amounts, interest rates, and repayment
behaviors.
3. To help stakeholders understand loan performance across various borrower categories and loan
purposes.
4. To support risk analysis and enhance decision-making processes for future loan disbursements.
