# Bank Loan Analysis on PowerBI
Banks and financial institutions regularly issue loans to individuals for various purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvement, or personal expenses. However, assessing the creditworthiness of applicants and monitoring the performance of issued loans is critical to minimizing defaults and maximizing returns. By analyzing loan data, banks can gain insights into borrower behavior, loan performance trends, and risk factors.
This project uses historical loan data to build a Power BI dashboard that enables better decision-making through visual insights.

Objectives of this project:
1. To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides visual analysis of loan-related metrics.
2. To identify key patterns and trends in loan issuance, funding amounts, interest rates, and repayment
behaviors.
3. To help stakeholders understand loan performance across various borrower categories and loan
purposes.
4. To support risk analysis and enhance decision-making processes for future loan disbursements.

Results:
i. Total Loans and Funding
● A total of 39.72K loans were issued.
● The total funded amount reached 435 million, reflecting a significant scale of operations.
● The cumulative interest rate is around 12%, showing moderate returns expected from the loan
portfolio.
ii. Year-wise Loan Trend
● There was a consistent increase in loan issuance from 2007 to 2011, peaking in 2011 with 261M
funded.
● This trend indicates growing borrower demand and possibly expanding risk appetite or operational
capabilities of the bank.
iii. Grade-wise Revolving Balance
● Grade B holds the largest share of revolving balance (30.35%), followed by Grades A (21.59%) and
C (20.72%).
● Lower grades like F and G represent minimal portions, suggesting lower risk tolerance for subprime
borrowers.
iv. Sub-grade Level Analysis
● Sub-grades B3, B5, and B4 are leading in terms of revolving balances (35M each), followed by C2,
C4, A1, etc.
v. Verification Status
● 68.19% of payments come from non-verified income borrowers, while 31.81% are from verified
borrowers.
● This could signal a reliance on self-declared financials, increasing potential risk exposure.
vi. Homeownership
● A majority of borrowers are under MORTGAGE (17.66K) and RENT (18.9K) categories.
● This shows lending is more popular among those with existing financial commitments, emphasizing
the need for strong repayment capability checks.
vii. Top Purpose Category
● Car loans are the most common purpose, possibly due to ease of approval or high demand.
viii. State-wise Loan Issuance
● California (CA) leads by a large margin with 7,099 loans, followed by Florida (FL) and New York
(NY).
● States like AZ, TX, GA also show high activity, while ID, HI, IA have significantly fewer loans.
● As sub-grade quality declines (E to G), balances drop drastically, aligning with risk-aware lending
practices.
