# PowerBI_Project1
Banking institutions face challenges in effectively evaluating loan applications and tracking repayment trends. Without a data-driven approach, they may encounter increased loan defaults, delayed payments, and inefficient portfolio management. This project aims in generating insights from a bank's loan analysis using PowerBI.
